This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid key prop to its items.  The key prop must be unique for each item in the data array.  If you use an index as the key, React Native won't correctly update items when data changes, causing incorrect rendering and potentially unexpected behavior.  This is especially problematic with complex data manipulations or frequent updates.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage - using index as key
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({item, index}) => (
    <Text key={index}>{item.name}</Text>
  )}
/>

```
